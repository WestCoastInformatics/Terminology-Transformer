<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The NDC-RXNORM transformer application provides an API and basic user
  interface for interacting with RXNORM concepts, NDC (National Drug Codes), and
  SPL (Standard Product Label) Set Ids. The tool is loaded with all versions of
  RXNORM dating back to June 2007 (the first appearance of NDC code data).</p>

<h4>REST API</h4>

  The REST API comprises six functions, four of which represent the core
  services and two of which are used to support the user interface. The full

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
  This is a sample application for demonstrating the
  <a href="http://www.westcoastinformatics.com/transformer.html">West Coast
    Informatics Transformer</a>
  application. The "transformer" is a terminology-enabled platform that can be
  configured to answer a variety of different kinds of questions by passing data
  elements through terminology-based algorithms to produce a result. Follow the
  link for more information about the platform itself.
</p>
<p>The NDC-RXNORM transformer application provides an API and basic user
  interface for interacting with RXNORM concepts, NDC (National Drug Codes), and
  SPL (Standard Product Label) Set Ids. The tool is loaded with all versions of
  RXNORM dating back to June 2007 (the first appearance of NDC code data).</p>
<p>As an instance of the Transformer application, this pipeline takes
  terminology codes (as either RXCUI, NDC, or SPL SetId) and transforms them
  into an information model representing broader and more historical picture of
  those data elements. While this is a relatively simple use case, it
  demonstrates how one type of data processed through terminology-enabled
  algorithms can emerge as a richer and more useful type of data.</p>

<br />
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Deployable locally</li>
  <li>Configurable security architecture</li>
  <li>Supports "unit" and "batch" requests</li>
  <li>Includes admin tools for easy updating to latest RXNORM version</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h4>
  <a href="swagger.html">REST API</a>
</h4>
<p>
  The REST API comprises six functions, four of which represent the core
  services and two of which are used to support the user interface. The full
  documentation for the API can be found by
  <a href="swagger.html">clicking the API link in the header</a>
  . Following is a description of the core services.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get NDC Info
    <ul>
      <li>Takes an NDC as a parameter and returns a document containing the
        current RXNORM concept, its active status, the current SPL Set Id, and
        the RXNORM concept history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get RXCUI Info
    <ul>
      <li>Takes an RXCUI (an RXNORM concept id) as a parameter and returns
        a document containing the RXNORM concept info, its active status, any
        associated SPL Set Ids, and a complete history of NDCs associated with
        it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get NDC Properties
    <ul>
      <li>Takes an NDC as a parameter and returns a document a containing
        details of the NDC, including various properties associated with it in
        RXNORM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get NDC Properties for SPL Set Id
    <ul>
      <li>Takes an SPL Set Id as a parameter NDC as a parameter and returns
        a document containing details of all of the NDCs associated with it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
